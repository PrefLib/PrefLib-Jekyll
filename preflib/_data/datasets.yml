    correspond to random dots presented to a user on Mechanical Turk, who is asked
    to rank the items from those containing the least dots (first) to those containing

    ranking which corresponds to the candidate names in sorted order.  In the Dots
    task, each task contains elements with 200, 200+i, 200+2i, and 200+3i dots, where
    i = {3, 5, 7, 9}.  This allows for more noise to be introduced to various iterations
    of the task.  For each i, 40 sets of puzzles were placed on Mechanical Turk and
    were ranked by 20 users.  As per the data owners request these 160 individual
    trails have been aggregated into a single file for each i.  The individual trial

    approval votes were collected at a set of polling stations in France during the
    first round of voting in the 2002 French National Election.  Voters in these districts
    were informed prior to the election that they would have the ability to cast an
    approval ballot along with their normal ballot for the election.  Overall, over
    75% of those who turned up to vote participated in the experiment.  Each of the
    files represent one district voting on the same election.  There are between 367
    and 476 voters (2,597 in all) and 16 candidates.  Additional details the method
    used to collect the data and results of analysis can be found in the required

    were posters B1-B17. There were 67 eligible voters (56 summer school participants,
    including the 34 poster presenters, as well as 7 lecturers and 4 organizers).
    Of these, 65 voters participated in the first election and 60 voters participated
    in the second election (1 voter did not vote in either election). The elections
    were conducted using the Whale3 system of Sylvain Bouveret.  Most of the posters
    are available at the summer school website.</p><p> The original data file (00033-00000001.dat)
    includes one column per poster. Each of the two sets of posters is ordered by
    the number of approvals received. Each row corresponds to a voter. The voters
    are ordered by the number of approvals they have given across both elections,
    except that the 7 voters who only participated in one of the two elections are
    listed last.  The other files are converted into standard PrefLib format where
    all approved alternatives are considered a tied equivalence class.</p>

  description: '<p>This dataset was collected by Green and Rao (1972), and is a standard
    example in the literature on multidimensional unfolding (which is about embedding
    preferences in Euclidean space). They obtained strict preference rankings over
    a collection of 15 sweet breakfast items (such as toast, muffins, donuts) from
    "a group of 42 respondents, 21 Wharton MBA students and their wives. The questionnaire
    was self-administered separately by husband and wife. All subjects independently
    filled out the same questionnaire and received compensation for their efforts."</p><p>Green
    and Rao asked for these preferences in 6 different situations: "Overall preferences",
    "When I''m having a breakfast consisting of juice, bacon and eggs, and beverage",
    "When I''m having a breakfast consisting of juice, cold cereal, and beverage",
    "When I''m having a breakfast consisting of juice, pancakes, sausage, and beverage",
    "Breakfast, with beverage only", "At snack time, with beverage only". The rankings
    for each of these situations are provided in separate data patches. A <em>.csv</em>
    file presents the ranking of a same respondent across the different data files;
    rankings in odd positions (1st, 3rd, ...) come from the MBA students, the ranking

  description: <p>This dataset contains bids of students over a set of projects for

    of supervision.  There are 8 years worth of data in this set and with between
    31 and 51 students and 56 and 155 projects. This data was kindly donated by <a
    href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~davidm/">David Manlove</a> who collected this
    data.</p><p>In addition to the strict and incomplete preference profiles of the
    students we have extended the profiles with all unranked items tied at the end.  We
    have also posted <b>.dat</b> files containing the supervisor identifiers and capacities.  The
    format for the .dat files is <i>Supervisor ID, Capacity, Projects</i>; where <i>Projects</i>
    is a space separated list of the projects supervised by the Supervisor.  Each
    project has a capacity of 1 while each supervisor has a variable capacity.  In
    academic sessions 2007-08 and 2008-09 there were no supervisor capacities in force,
    thus the projects and supervisors are in 1-1 correspondence.</p>

    contains a daily ranking of the 200 most listened songs in 53 different countries.
    In our elections, candidates model songs. For each month and each country, we
    created an election where each vote corresponds to the ranking of the songs on
    one day of the month in the country.</p> <p>Each patch contains the raw election
    and a post-processed version where some candidates and voters are deleted to make
    the election complete. The name of a patch starts with an abbreviation of the
    relevant country followed by the relevant year and the month. Note that the names
    of candidates are the IDs of the respective songs on spotify (e.g., candidate
    10nqz67NQWWa7XPq7ycihi corresponds to "Welcome to New York" from Taylor Swift

  description: <p>The dataset consists of two pre-camp surveys, conducted for youth
    summer camps in 2022 and 2023 in Poland. Several weeks before each camp, campers
    were asked to fill out a survey, which included (among others) two questions related
    to CCM-genre music pieces. Responses to each question form an approval election.
    So, for each year, we obtained two elections.</p> <p>In the first question, survey
    participants--that is, voters---were presented approximately 80 song titles---candidates.
    The participants were asked to select at least 15 of their favorite ones to sing
    during camp activities. The lower bound on the number of selections was not enforced.
    In the second question, which involved far fewer songs (around ten), the participants
    were asked to select songs they would like to learn. This time, there was no indication
    of the number of choices, hence, some participants selected none.</p> <p>The questions
    remained the same in all years, however, the presented songs were different. Specifically,
    in 2022, the first and second questions involved 78 and 8 songs, respectively.
    A year later, the respective numbers were 82 and 10. The survey had 39 participants
    in 2022 and 56 in 2023.</p> <p> The data on this page has been donated by <a href="https://akaczmarczyk.com/">Andrzej

  description: <p> This dataset contains the results of a simple experiment regarding
    voting over landscape images with varying displaying order. There are 19 agents,
    each voting in two rounds. Eight images (alternatives) are denoted by A through
    H. In the first round, the images were displayed in the sequence A, B, C, D, E,
    F, G, H, while in the second round, the sequence was D, C, B, A, H, G, F, E.</p><p>To
    allow identify voters from the first to the second round, in addition to our standard
    file formats, we provide a CSV file that provides the preferences submitted by
    a voter in both rounds.</p><p>These data were donated by Honorata Sosnowska from
    the SGH Warsaw School of Economics. The work concerned with the data was supported
    by the SGH Warsaw School of Economics grant KAE/S21 and the National Center for
    Science grant UMO-2018/31/B/HS4/01005 Opus 16.</p>
