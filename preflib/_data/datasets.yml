    ranking which corresponds to the candidate names in sorted order.  In the Dots

    i = {3, 5, 7, 9}.  This allows for more noise to be introduced to various iterations
    of the task.  For each i, 40 sets of puzzles were placed on Mechanical Turk and
    were ranked by 20 users.  As per the data owners request these 160 individual
    trails have been aggregated into a single file for each i.  The individual trial

    approval votes were collected at a set of polling stations in France during the
    first round of voting in the 2002 French National Election.  Voters in these districts
    were informed prior to the election that they would have the ability to cast an
    approval ballot along with their normal ballot for the election.  Overall, over
    75% of those who turned up to vote participated in the experiment.  Each of the

    including the 34 poster presenters, as well as 7 lecturers and 4 organizers).
    Of these, 65 voters participated in the first election and 60 voters participated
    in the second election (1 voter did not vote in either election). The elections
    were conducted using the Whale3 system of Sylvain Bouveret.  Most of the posters

    includes one column per poster. Each of the two sets of posters is ordered by
    the number of approvals received. Each row corresponds to a voter. The voters
    are ordered by the number of approvals they have given across both elections,
    except that the 7 voters who only participated in one of the two elections are
    listed last.  The other files are converted into standard PrefLib format where
    all approved alternatives are considered a tied equivalence class.</p>

    have weight 1 unless they connect from a patient to an altruist (who does not
    need a kidney), which have weight 0. </p> <p> There is a <b>dat</b> file associated

    the blood type of the person needing the kidney; <b>Donor</b> the blood type of
    the person donating the kidney; <b>Wife-P?</b> 1 if the person needing the kidney
    is the wife of the donor; <b>%Pra</b> denotes the panel reactive antibody level
    of the patient, discretized into three levels; <b>Out-Deg</b> the number of nodes

    data.</p><p>In addition to the strict and incomplete preference profiles of the
    students we have extended the profiles with all unranked items tied at the end.  We
    have also posted <b>.dat</b> files containing the supervisor identifiers and capacities.  The
    format for the .dat files is <i>Supervisor ID, Capacity, Projects</i>; where <i>Projects</i>
    is a space separated list of the projects supervised by the Supervisor.  Each
    project has a capacity of 1 while each supervisor has a variable capacity.  In
    academic sessions 2007-08 and 2008-09 there were no supervisor capacities in force,
    thus the projects and supervisors are in 1-1 correspondence.</p>

    In our elections, candidates model songs. For each month and each country, we
    created an election where each vote corresponds to the ranking of the songs on
    one day of the month in the country.</p> <p>Each patch contains the raw election
    and a post-processed version where some candidates and voters are deleted to make
    the election complete. The name of a patch starts with an abbreviation of the
    relevant country followed by the relevant year and the month. Note that the names
    of candidates are the IDs of the respective songs on spotify (e.g., candidate
    10nqz67NQWWa7XPq7ycihi corresponds to "Welcome to New York" from Taylor Swift

  description: <p>The dataset consists of two pre-camp surveys, conducted for youth
    summer camps in 2022 and 2023 in Poland. Several weeks before each camp, campers
    were asked to fill out a survey, which included (among others) two questions related
    to CCM-genre music pieces. Responses to each question form an approval election.
    So, for each year, we obtained two elections.</p> <p>In the first question, survey
    participants--that is, voters---were presented approximately 80 song titles---candidates.
    The participants were asked to select at least 15 of their favorite ones to sing
    during camp activities. The lower bound on the number of selections was not enforced.
    In the second question, which involved far fewer songs (around ten), the participants
    were asked to select songs they would like to learn. This time, there was no indication
    of the number of choices, hence, some participants selected none.</p> <p>The questions
    remained the same in all years, however, the presented songs were different. Specifically,
    in 2022, the first and second questions involved 78 and 8 songs, respectively.
    A year later, the respective numbers were 82 and 10. The survey had 39 participants
    in 2022 and 56 in 2023.</p> <p> The data on this page has been donated by <a href="https://akaczmarczyk.com/">Andrzej

  description: <p>This dataset presents data collected as part of the Comparative
    Study of Electoral Systems. This study consists of post-election studies from
    (federal) elections from different countries. In some of these post-election studies,
    participants were asked to rank all important political parties or leaders in
    their country that they know on a scale from 0 to 10 according to how much they
    agree with the views of the party. For each of the 174 post-election studies where
    this question was asked, a data file was created with the parties as candidates.
    Each voter in the data file then corresponds to a participant in the survey and
    ranks the parties according to the participant's answer. Check the <a href="https://cses.org/">website
