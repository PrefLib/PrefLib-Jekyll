<h1>Kidney Exchange</h1>

<p>Kidney failure is a life-threatening health issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. In the US alone, the waitlist for a kidney transplant has over 100,000 patients. This list is growing: demand far outstrips supply.This codebase includes: structural elements of kidney exchange like "pools", "hospitals", and "pairs", a couple of kidney exchange graph generators, a couple of kidney exchange solvers (max weight, failure-aware, fairness-aware, individually rational), and a dynamic kidney exchange simulator.</p>

<h3>Versions and History</h3>

<h2>What is kidney exchange?</h2>

<p>Kidney failure is a life-threatening health issue that affects hundreds of thousands of people worldwide. In the US alone, the waitlist for a kidney transplant has over 100,000 patients. This list is growing: demand far outstrips supply.</p>

<p>A recent innovation, kidney exchange, allows patients to bring an (incompatible) donor to a large pool where they can swap donors with other patients. As of 2012–2013, roughly 10% of US kidney transplants occurred through a variety of kidney exchanges. Outside of the US, many countries (the UK, the Netherlands, Portugal, Israel, ...) are fielding exchanges.</p>

<h2>What is this code?</h2>

<p>This codebase includes: structural elements of kidney exchange like "pools", "hospitals", and "pairs", a couple of kidney exchange graph generators, a couple of kidney exchange solvers (max weight, failure-aware, fairness-aware, individually rational), and a dynamic kidney exchange simulator.</p>

<p>If you use this codebase, please cite one of our recent papers like:</p>

</ul>

<p>**NOTE:** This is _not_ the code used in the <a href="https://unos.org/transplant/kidney-paired-donation/">UNOS Kidney Paired Donation Pilot Program (KPDPP)</a>. The solvers here are meant to be accessible research code for the community and do not use branch-and-price, hopefully resulting in greater ease of use (at the cost of scalability). Forks and pull requests welcome!</p>

<h2>External Dependencies</h2>

<p>To use any of the solvers that inherit from CPLEXSolver, you will need to add cplex.jar to lib/. This will allow compilation; to run, you'll also need a VM argument like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Djava.library.path=/path/to/CPLEX_Studio/cplex/bin/your-architecture/</li>
</ul>

<p>IBM offers a free academic license for CPLEX as well as a 90-day free trial available on their website.</p>
